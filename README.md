# MLSysOps Framework

The **MLSysOps Framework** is the open-source result of the Horizon Europe _MLSysOps_ project (Grant‚ÄØID‚ÄØ101092912), running from Jan 2023 to Dec 2025. It delivers an AI-enabled, agent-based platform for autonomic, cross-layer management of compute, storage, and network resources across cloud, edge, and IoT environments.

---

## üöÄ Key Objectives

- Provide an **AI-ready, open framework** for scalable and explainable operations across heterogeneous infrastructures.
- Enable **continual ML learning and retraining** at runtime using hierarchical agents.
- Support **portable and efficient execution** via containers and modular, FaaS-style offloading.
- Promote **green, resource-efficient, and secure operations** while maintaining QoS/QoE.
- Enable **realistic evaluation** through deployments in smart city and precision agriculture scenarios.

## üß© Core Components

- **Hierarchical Agent Architecture**  
  Interfaces with orchestration/control systems and supports plug-and-play ML models.

- **Telemetry & Control Knobs**  
  Collects metrics and dynamically tunes compute, network, storage, and accelerators.

- **Distributed FaaS-style Executor**  
  Offloads functions across layers to optimize latency, energy, and performance.

- **Explainable ML & RL Modules**  
  Provides transparent decision-making and insight into agent behavior.

- **Real-world Use Cases**  
  Includes smart city and precision agriculture applications.
